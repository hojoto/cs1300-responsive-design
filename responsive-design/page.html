        <h2> The Project</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> The goal of this project was to find a website and improve it's design and responsiveness.
            I chose to redisgn the U.S Passport site, since it is crucial to anybody who needs to apply 
            for, renew, or do anything regarding their American passport or Visa. It is designed poorly,
            and as a result, makes this crucial process unnecessarily hard.

        <h3> Identifying The Issues</h3>
        <p>Here is the link to the page: <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html</a></p>
        <h4>Design Issues</h4>
        <p>Here are the main issues I identified on the page:</p>
        <li>There is too much information on this website - users are quickly overwhelmed by the number of buttons and possibilities. This makes the learnability and memorability of the website poor.</li>
        <li>Poor conceptual model - it is not an intuitive design for users to immediately start using</li>
        <li>Very little visual heirarchy/ visual flow - users are not given a clear path of what to do or look at</li>
        <li>Unneccessary features - are social media buttons really important to include on the page? Passport news?</li>
        <li>Missing features - most notably missing a "help" button</li>
        <h4>Accessibility issues</h4>
        <li>WAVE report: 13 errors, 2 contrast errors, 33 Alerts, 4 features, 86 structural elements, 28 ARIA</li>
        <li>9 elements missing alt texts</li>
        <li>The text is too small, readability is weak</li>
        <li>Poor text contrast on labels</li>
        <li>Only other available language is Spanish. However, not even all the text is translated when in Spanish mode.</li>
        <li>Overall poor responsiveness and visual spacing on various screen sizes.</li>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2> Prototyping</h2>
        <p>After identifying the issues with the page, I made low-fidelity prototypes and then high fidelty prototypes. I tried to address every major problem I had with the old website:</p>
        <li>Cut out a lot of visual junk by compressing the navigation bar into a "hamburger menu"</li>
        <li>Cut out a lot of unnecessary features such as the social media buttons</li>
        <li>Made the website responsive by using media queries</li>
        <li>Improved the learnability and conceptual model by adding a "start" button and better visual flow</li>
        <li>Improved accessibility with alt tags, multiple language support, larger text, good contrast ratios for text, and adding a help button</li>
